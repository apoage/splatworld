# Changelog

All notable changes. Versions are bumped by the dark-factory release ritual
(implementer lane); this initial entry was seeded by the orchestrator.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-11
Foundational milestones, built before the factory was set up:
- **M0** — GDGS render path in Godot 4.7 + bidirectional splat/mesh depth occlusion
  (required a GDGS↔Godot-4.7 push-constant patch; see `docs/decisions.md`).
- **M1** — precompute pipeline end to end: frames → COLMAP SfM → undistort → gsplat
  `train_base` → `export` (extended schema). Proven on `pxl_144634` foliage
  (204/204 frames registered, 2.39M gaussians, 21.71 dB held-out PSNR).
- Precompute scaffold: `schema.py` contract, `ply_io.py` (+ golden tests 5/5),
  `colmap_io.py`, `train_base.py`, `export.py`, `run.py`.
- Toolchain on the local 3090: Godot 4.7, torch/gsplat cu124, COLMAP (isolated env).
